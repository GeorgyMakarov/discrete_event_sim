## Discrete event simulation in R

### Executive summary

Project shows how to use `simmer` package in R to simulate discrete events.
Discrete events simulation is helpful in management of services and/or
industrial manufacturing companies with serial production process. This
project consists of **3** parts.

First part of the project provides understanding of what is DES and how it
can help in taking data driven decisions. It is roughly based on:  

- [Stat Pharm video]  
- [Simmer docs]  

Second part of the project shows an abstract example of *DES* for a simple
queuing process of customers. This part's purpose is to give you an idea of
how you could organize your processes using data.

Third part of the project is a practical implementation of *DES* to a real
world sawmill process. The core idea of this part is to show how to deal
with obstacles that may arise during process improvement.
