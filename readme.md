## Discrete event simulation in R

Project shows how to use `simmer` package in R to simulate discrete events.
Discrete events simulation is helpful in management of services and/or
industrial manufacturing companies with serial production process. This
project consists of **3** parts.

First part of the project provides understanding of what is DES and how it
can help in taking data driven decisions. It is roughly based on:
